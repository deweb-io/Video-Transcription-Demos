76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
So, I mean, I think that for folks on my side,

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I sort of have the same message for everybody on all sides,

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
which is that the world did not begin spinning when you were born.

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
And there's a great amount of wisdom, accumulated wisdom,

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
that has built up over literally thousands of years,

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
in the United States over hundreds of years,

82
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
that is well worth going back to as a source of both inspiration

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
and understanding of exactly why the system is supposed to work

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
in a particular way.

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
And that requires a certain understanding of human nature,

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
of human beings, as both capable of amazing things,

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
but also as inherently flawed and ambitious,

88
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
and why you need a governmental system that is capable

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
of checking ambition with ambition, checks and balances,

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
subsidiarity, the belief in a federalist system

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
that allows for experimentation on a local level

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
without attempting to cram one-size-fits-all solutions

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
on everybody from the federal level.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
But that begins with reading history.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
It does begin with understanding some basic philosophies

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
about how the United States works.

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Because if it feels like the country is coming apart,

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
and it really does feel like that more and more every day,

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
that is because I think that there is a failure to agree

100
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
on some of the central bases for the country.

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
So we're either going to have to clarify where the disagreements are,

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
or we're going to be in serious trouble as a country.
