45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Well, I think that my generation is certainly pretty passionate

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
about changing things,

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
certainly changing the way that they work and live.

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
We're seeing that play out currently with the pandemic

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
and the labor shortage that's taking place.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
And I'd like them to know that we don't really need to reinvent the wheel.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
We've seen strategies and solutions that have worked in the past.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
This country has gone through many terrible things in its history.

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,800
It's a very short history, you know, relative to other countries.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
And despite all of those awful things that have happened,

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
things like the Great Depression, for instance,

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
that country was still able to pull through.

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,800
And I would suggest looking to history at the solutions that worked,

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
specifically a strong labor movement,

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
in order to, you know, really rework the power dynamic

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
that we're seeing right now in the workplace.

61
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,800
I think a lot of the reasoning for not going back to the jobs

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
that workers were previously working in prior to the pandemic

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
has to do with the fact that, hey, you know,

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
we've been staying home during the lockdown.

65
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Now we realize that spending time with our family,

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
having a little free time for ourselves,

67
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
being able to go outdoors and do recreational things,

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
that's important to us.

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,800
So they're reimagining what their lives could be like

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
if they take a little bit of power back in the workplace.

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
And I think that that's definitely possible.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
They just got to fight for it. They got to organize.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
They got to work together and not get distracted

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
by manufactured culture wars that we see play out in the media every day.
