282
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah.

283
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
No, I mean, you actually brought up a few issues that I agree with.

284
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Number one issue is the constant policing of people's pasts,

285
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
what they've said in the past.

286
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I think holding people to the current standards

287
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
based on the current culture,

288
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,800
you know, if you're looking at tweets, for instance, from 2009

289
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
and you're judging that tweet based on what the current culture

290
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
or the current standards are, it's a little ridiculous, right?

291
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,800
So going around demonizing people based on their past statements,

292
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,800
it shuts down a conversation that could be had, right?

293
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
A conversation about, oh, hey, look,

294
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,800
society has actually progressed on this and, you know, look at what was okay.

295
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I mean, you have late night hosts who were in Blackface not too long ago, right?

296
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
But the culture has changed.

297
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I think that, you know, society as a whole, not everyone,

298
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
but society as a whole has realized,

299
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,800
oh, well, Blackface has a pretty terrible history

300
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
and maybe it's not a good idea to dress like that

301
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
as like a cute little Halloween costume.

302
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,800
But beside the point, you know, I don't think that the culture wars are fake.

303
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I think the culture wars are taking place.

304
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,800
The point that I'm trying to make is that oftentimes

305
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
whatever the culture war is of that moment,

306
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
it is manufactured as a distraction.

307
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
A perfect example would be, you know, critical race theory,

308
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
which is not taught in elementary schools.

309
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Critical race theory is a graduate-level curriculum.

310
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
And the fact that it's turned into some weird, like,

311
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
oh, we need to ban critical race theory in elementary schools,

312
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
it's ridiculous and a massive distraction

313
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
that I think is intentionally meant to be a distraction

314
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
from what people are really feeling frustrated about,

315
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
the precariousness of their lives, of their work lives,

316
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
the fact that people feel overworked,

317
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
that they have no control over the work that they're doing,

318
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
that they feel alienated over the work that they're doing.

319
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
These are very real issues, and I think that, you know,

320
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
the fact that it's really largely been ignored

321
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
by both the press and the very political leaders

322
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
who were elected to represent them in the first place

323
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
has led to the anger that we're seeing bubbling up,

324
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
both on the left and the right.
