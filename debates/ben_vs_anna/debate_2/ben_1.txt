233
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I certainly agree with an enormous amount of what Anna is saying

234
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
about the nature of sort of the world that we live in,

235
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
where people feel as though they are going to be ostracized socially.

236
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
They feel that they might be fired, depending on their political point of view.

237
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
They feel as though if they make comments openly,

238
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
and this is true for pretty much everybody across the political aisle,

239
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
actually, with the exception of people who consider themselves on the far left.

240
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
According to Cato's study, basically every political subgroup in the United States

241
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
feels uncomfortable speaking openly about what they believe,

242
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
except if you're on the far left,

243
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
because then you get to find people's old tweets and do that sort of stuff.

244
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I'm not going to pretend that I think that the culture wars are irrelevant.

245
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I don't.

246
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I think that many of the culture wars are highly relevant.

247
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
And not just relevant, I think that they may be indicative

248
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
of sort of where the country is going.

249
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Because the way that most people experience interactions with the government,

250
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
particularly the federal government or with politics generally,

251
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,800
is not always based on tax rates or the very minute internecine debates

252
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
that we have over $3.5 trillion bills that nobody knows what's in,

253
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
and then everybody just votes before they read the thing.

254
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
A lot of the way that people engage in politics...

255
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
I can tell you guys.

256
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm sure we'll get into it.

257
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I think that a lot of the ways that socially,

258
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,800
there's been a pretty strong push from the left

259
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
over the course of the last ten years in particular,

260
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
and it's driven a lot of reactionary resentment

261
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
on the part of people who are on the right.

262
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
And I would suggest that a lot of the support for President Trump, for example,

263
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
was driven by precisely that.

264
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
It wasn't just about his economic program,

265
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
which differed from sort of the traditional laissez-faire

266
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Republican economic program.

267
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
A lot of it was about the idea that he was a culture warrior

268
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
who was going to punish enemies and all of this.

269
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
And so to pretend that the culture war either doesn't exist

270
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
or that people are making it up in their imagination

271
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
or that they are overestimating the impact of it on their life

272
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
is to ignore how people are being treated

273
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
in the spaces that they treat with every day,

274
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
on Facebook, on Twitter, in the workplace.

275
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I mean, one of the reasons that my family and I left California

276
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
is not just because of the living standard,

277
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
although Florida is way better,

278
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
it is also because we left a place where we felt as though

279
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
our children were going to be socially ostracized

280
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
for a place where we feel our children are not going to be socially ostracized,

281
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
and that's a big thing.
