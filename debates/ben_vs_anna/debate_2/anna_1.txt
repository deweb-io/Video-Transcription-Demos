189
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I think that both sides certainly engage in manufactured culture wars,

190
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
and it's frustrating to see it.

191
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Full disclosure, I myself have engaged in it,

192
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,800
and I think instead of being oblivious or delusional about it,

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,800
it's important to acknowledge when you've made the mistakes, right?

194
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800
And so the demonizing doesn't help.

195
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,800
At the end of the day, we have to realize that we're all Americans.

196
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
We all want the same thing.

197
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Fundamentally, we are the same.

198
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
We might have different solutions, different ideas.

199
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Demonizing the other side doesn't help to accomplish any solutions.

200
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Again, we're seeing that play out in real time as we speak.

201
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I think that there's a market for the division,

202
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
and that market is being exploited by our media.

203
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
It's being exploited by politicians.

204
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,800
And, I mean, Facebook is in the news today.

205
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I think that Facebook, you know, it makes money based on engagement,

206
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
and people are engaged in the constant conflict.

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,800
So it's important to be honest about what the real threats in society are.

208
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I think it's important to focus on why it is that, you know,

209
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,800
certain industries, including the media, engage in this culture of division.

210
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
And we ought to talk about how the incentives are in the wrong place.

211
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
I mean, there are no incentives to engage in, you know,

212
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
friendly conversation or friendly debate.

213
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I hate that my chair keeps, you know, and I'm short,

214
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
so I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

215
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I hate turning my back to people.

216
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Here, I'll just do this. I'll sit on the very edge.

217
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,800
But, you know, we got to be aware of why it is that people engage

218
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
in the divisive rhetoric that they engage in.

219
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
There's a profit motive behind it oftentimes.

220
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I see it play out in the media.

221
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
It's really, really hard not to fall victim to it myself, right?

222
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,800
But when I take a step back and I look at where the country is right now,

223
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
it's shameful, you know?

224
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
We don't see each other as fellow Americans.

225
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,800
We don't see each other as even fellow colleagues or workers in the workplace.

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Everyone has a political identity, and that's it.

227
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
And that's not helpful.

228
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I think the division in the country is incredibly embarrassing,

229
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
especially on a world stage.

230
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,800
And we got to be more cognizant of that as we engage in political discussions.
