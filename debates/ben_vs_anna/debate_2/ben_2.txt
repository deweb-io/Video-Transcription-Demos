327
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I mean, I obviously disagree with you about critical race theory

328
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
and whether it is taught in the public schools.

329
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Critical race theory, which I studied in law school,

330
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
it started off as a legal theory,

331
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
but it has an element of praxis and practice

332
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
which is why it is taught in education schools as well,

333
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
and why...

334
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
In elementary schools?

335
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Yes, a very boiled-down...

336
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I mean, Ibram X. Kendi is preaching

337
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
a very boiled-down version of critical race theory,

338
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
and his book is assigned in elementary schools.

339
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I mean, the fact is that when you are having elementary school students

340
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
who are having to check off boxes with regard to their race

341
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
and then explain to each other

342
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
whether they are historically privileged or not in fourth or fifth grade,

343
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
that's a very dumbed-down version of critical race theory.

344
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
There's sort of a game that gets played with regard to legal theories

345
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
that end up being boiled down.

346
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Intersectionality is another great example of this.

347
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Kimberly Crenshaw writes a very intelligent law review article

348
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
about intersectionality and how you can be a member

349
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
of more than one minority group

350
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
and be discriminated against in a variety of ways.

351
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
And then that is used as the basis

352
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
for a much broader move in American political life.

353
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
And then as soon as you point that out,

354
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
they say, well, that's not intersectionality.

355
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
It's the original law review article.

356
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
That's a bit of no-true Scotsman games playing.

357
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
And so I object to that.

358
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
And look, it is a relevant issue when you have Terry McAuliffe,

359
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
who's running for governor of Virginia,

360
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
but it should not be parents who are making educational decisions

361
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
for their children.

362
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
It should be the people in education.

363
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I mean, that is a culture war issue that I think is of key importance

364
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
to people who have kids, right?
